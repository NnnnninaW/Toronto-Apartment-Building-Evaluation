# Toronto-Apartment-Building-Evaluation
Apartment building safety is essential for both landlords and tenants. In 2019, a water pipe burst inside the garbage disposal room of 260 Wellesley St. E. at Toronto. The water subsequently leaked into the 33-storey buildingâ€™s electrical room. After the flood, the Electrical Safety Authority ordered Toronto Hydro to disconnect power to ensure there was no catastrophic or large-scale electrical failure. However, with no electricity to the building, fire and life safety protection systems are offline, triggering Toronto Fire Services to issue the order for the fire watch. Unpredictable emergencies associated with building safety could have severe ripple effects in various aspects that harm the safety environment of everyone.

Apartment building safety is essential for both landlords and tenants. Dataset of Apartment Building Evaluation from Open Data Toronto is utilized to analyze the current status of building safety evaluation which does not appear to have capabilities of detecting severe potential risks like construction damage, hazards resistance, and housing age problem. Through aging, any facility may experience progressive growth of risk, due to deterioration of building materials or other natural physical forces.  To provoke safety awareness for everyone, expanding the diversity and coverage of building safety evaluation is necessary as next step for our city.
